## 💡 Advanced Copilot Techniques

### Effective Agent Mode Prompting

#### 1. Creating Specialized Agents
```
You are a senior security architect with 15 years of experience in fintech applications.
Review this codebase for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and PCI-DSS compliance issues.
Focus on authentication, authorization, data encryption, and input validation.
```

#### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
```
Agent 1 (Architect): Analyze the system architecture and identify service boundaries
Agent 2 (DBA): Review data models and suggest optimal schema for each service
Agent 3 (API Designer): Design RESTful APIs based on the identified boundaries
```

#### 3. Context-Rich Analysis
```
This is a 50K LOC legacy Node.js application with Express, MySQL, and jQuery.
Database has 200+ tables with complex relationships.
Analyze the order processing module (files: orders/*.js) and suggest:
1. Performance bottlenecks
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Opportunities for microservices extraction
```

#### 4. Incremental Guidance
```
I'm modernizing this callback-based Express route to async/await.
Step 1: Identify all callback chains
Step 2: Show me the first callback to convert
Step 3: Help me write comprehensive tests
Step 4: Perform the conversion safely
```

### Working with Large Codebases

1. **Start Broad, Go Deep**: Begin with high-level architecture analysis, then drill into specifics
2. **Use File Patterns**: Analyze similar files together for consistency
3. **Maintain Context**: Reference previous agent insights in follow-up questions
4. **Document Decisions**: Use agents to generate ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
5. **Validate Continuously**: Test after each agent-suggested change
